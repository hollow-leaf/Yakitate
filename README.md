### Abstract

Yakitate,the decentralized food bank, using Algorand blockchain and smart contracts, connects food suppliers and users transparently. It ensures authentic tracking of production and fair resource allocation. The user-friendly app streamlines food donations and access. This project enhances efficiency, breaks donation food distribution bottlenecks, and fosters community collaboration for a more equitable and sustainable food system.

### Introduction

The goal of our project is to realize a decentralized food bank platform provider. We use Algorand to store and retrieve the acquired food donations metadata, and provide food to receiver, who can obtain food and track food source.

Our solution has the following features and advantages:

- Provide a food platform to facilitate food distribution and inquiry
- Tracking food sources
- Implement a food map so that receivers can get donated food nearby
- Receivers can freely choose the type of food they want

### Method

- Use [Algorand](https://www.algorand.foundation/) to store food donations metadata
- Use [Perawallet](https://docs.perawallet.app/) to build web connect wallet that interacts with algorand blockchain
- Use [Teal](https://developer.algorand.org/docs/get-details/dapps/avm/teal/) to create algorand smart contract
- Use Next.js to build web frontend

### Building & Installation

> Yakitate is a monorepo managed using turbo. You can find the source code for each package in the apps/web3 and apps/algorand directory.

- apps/web3 is the web frontend for Yakitate. It is built using [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/).
- apps/algorand is the algorand smart contract for Yakitate.It is built using [Teal](https://developer.algorand.org/docs/get-details/dapps/avm/teal/) and Python.
